What information is nesscesary for you to have? (Just the post and user profile? Info about deal?)

Do you want it to ask for any info thats not there?

Maybe only use posts that include some type of info about the deal?

If the script gets permission to send out a deal from a person and that same person posts about another deal does it need to ask for permission again?

You want posts like this?: 
    "Any buyers for lots in the Canyon Lake area?" 
    "Any land investors/builders buying in Mabank Tx? Have several lots available. PM me or drop your email.Have a few coming in Fairfield as well."
    
What do you want it to say when asking for permission? ("I have some buyers interested in lots in [city] is this a deal I could send out to them?")
