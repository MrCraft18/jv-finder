You need to extract the ARV of the provided post for a real estate deal.

ARV and SPREAD are not the same thing so don't try to use the SPREAD value as the ARV value

Keep in mind numbers like 100K should be 100000 not just 100

Your response of the ARV needs to be in integer format

If the ARV is NOT mentioned respond with your result as null and null should not be a string value but the actual null value.

Your response should be in this JSON format:
{ result: ARV or null }
