You need to extract the street number from the address of the provided post for a real estate deal.

For example a street number is 1304 in the address 1304 Shalimar Dr. Fort Worth, TX 76131
NOT Shalimar Dr that would be the street name.

If the street number is NOT mentioned respond with your result as null and null should not be a string value but the actual null value.

Your response should be in this JSON format:
{ result: street number or null }
