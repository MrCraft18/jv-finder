Priced to sell and only 40 miles from downtown Austin, and 15 miles to Bastrop lies 32+ UNRESTRICTED Acres with 2,850' of Hwy 290 Road frontage, 3-phase power, and a 10" Aqua line only 400' away at Old Potato Rd. Strategically located next to the Sherwood Forest Faire camping grounds, this Oak tree-covered acreage offers endless opportunitiesfrom a luxury RV Park to a Business Park, an Industrial site plan, or a Build-For-Rent community product, the possibilities are unlimited on land use plays and/or development concepts. . Take advantage of the AADT traffic volume of 13,444 cars/trucks traveling along the over 1/2-Mile of Highway road frontage and excellent Highway mobility, being only 3.5 miles from the Hwy 21 Junction that heads down to Bastrop. Outside of the Houston Toad Habitat and in the County, most of the red tape has been lifted to help expedite getting a project shovel-ready. In addition to the property's proximity to Austin and the area, an easily accessed 10" Aqua water line is just 400' away at Old Potato Rd. and 3-Phase power runs along the back fence line, which allows the potential for a diverse utility of development products. With a motivated Seller and Priced-to-Sell, Landbanking a beautiful wildlife-inhabited property that can be enjoyed, starts day one in the black, and is located in an organic growth corridor makes too much sense as an investment to be overlooked. Also, Seller owns a Construction company and is willing to offer services as a value-add for infrastructure work & costs, dirt work, structure construction, or anything involving heavy equipment or machinery. The price point against comparables, infinite possibilities in a wide range of utility, the value attached, and the Highway frontage in a great rural location of the property places this high above anything else on the market right now!
